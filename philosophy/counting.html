    <h1>You can count on me</h1>

    <h2>Am I losing my marbles?</h2>
    <p>
Let's say Argle is looking at a selection of marbles on a table. Argle counts them and finds that there are four marbles.
Argle move the marbles one by one from the left hand side of the table to the right hand side, feeling each one in their hands as they count them - one, two, three, four.
Argle has sufficient experience here to ground their belief that there are four marbles. Argle knows how to count, of course! Argle has attended school where they were taught how to count and do calculations, and after learning the procedure has been doing it correctly their entire life (save from a few mistakes here and there). But Argle does not believe they are mistaken here - they are of sound mind, sober, and went through the counting procedure meticulously just to eliminate any doubt that the visual inspection of the four marbles was an incorrect guess.

Argle justifiably believes there are four marbles on the table, and cannot conceive of any reason to doubt that fact.

Bargle approaches the table. They inspect the marbles visually and perform the same counting operation, moving the marbles one by one across the table. Bargle arrived at the conclusion that there are 5 marbles on the table, and are steadfast in their belief. They are certain of this count in much the same way that Argle is.

How is it possible that Argle and Bargle have arrived at such drastically contradictory conclusions?

    <h2>Laying it out on the table.</h2>
    <p>
Here is the outline:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Argle and Bargle can both count.</li>
        <li>Argle and Bargle both speak the same language, which encompasses the language and rules for counting.</li>
        <li>Argle and Bargle are both of sound mind.</li>
        <li>Argle and Bargle have adequate vision and are not sensorially impaired.</li>
        <li>Argle and Bargle are looking at the same table, at the same time, at the same set of marbles, which do not leave the table nor their sight of view during their friendly investigations.</li>
        <li>Argle counts four marbles on the table.</li>
        <li>Bargle counts five marbles on the table.</li>
        <li>Four is not equal to five.</li>
        <li>Argle and Bargle both believe they are correct in their count, and believe the other person is incorrect.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Bargle Blunder</h2>
    <p>
Suppose Argle turns to Bargle and says "Can I see how you are counting?". Bargle obliges.
"First I take one marble from the pile on the left and into a new pile on the right", Bargle narrates as he moves the first marble. "Then I do the same with the second marble," which he does indeed move. "Then I do the same with the third marble," which he does, "and with the fourth marble," again moving the marble across, "then with the fifth marble", where he moves a marble from the right pile back to the left temporarily before placing it back again on the right-hand side."
"Ah," says Argle. "You double counted the fifth marble. You do not know how to count correctly, that's your mistake."
"But this is how I was taught to count!"
"Then you were taught incorrectly. Here, let me show you the correct way."

One can imagine a similar mistake happening with Argle, where two marbles are counted as one. This scenario is straightforwardly a mistake by one of the parties in their methods of inquiry, in how they process information to synthesize a fact.

"Let's try something else," says Argle. "For each marble I move across, I will place a finger down on my hand. This way we can keep track of the marbles we have counted."
"Of course," says Bargle.
Argle moves one marble from the left pile to the right, and places one finger down.
Argle moves another marble from the left pile to the right, and places another finger down.
Argle moves another marble from the left pile to the right, and places another finger down.
Argle moves another marble from the left pile to the right, and places another finger down.
"See?" says Argle, "I have moved all the marbles across, and for each one, have placed a finger down. You agree I have moved all the marbles across?"
"Yes," says Bargle.
"And you agree I have placed four fingers down on my hand?"
"Yes, I can see that clearly."
"And the number of fingers I have placed down is equal to the number of marbles I have moved across?"
"Yes, that was the rule we agreed on."
"Then you must agree that there are four marbles!"
Bargle looks from the marbles to Argle's hand. "No, the rules for counting marbles are different to the rules for counting fingers."
"You're being incoherent" says Argle. "You clearly do not understand basic mathematics."
    </p>

    <h2>Words</h2>
    <p>
"Count the marbles one by one," says Argle to Bargle.
"Easily," says Bargle, who proceeds to count the marbles one by one as they move the marbles across the table.
"One, two, three, five," says Bargle.
"Ah", says Argle. "What you say by five is what I say by four. The correct way to count is to say one, two, three, four."

"Count the marbles one by one," says Bargle to Argle.
"Easily," says Argle. "One, two, three, glorble, five."
"Ah," says Bargle. "This is where you are going wrong. There is no number called glorble, there's no marble that you even moved when you said it! The correct way to count is to say one, two, three, four. What you call glorble is what I call four."
"You are being ridiculous!" Argle protests. "This is how marbles are counted. If there were only four marbles, I would have said one, two, three, four. But there are five marbles, and the rule I have for counting for numbers greater than four is to say one, two, three, then glorble, then five."
"Where on earth did you learn that?" Bargle exclaims. "I want to have a word with your teachers."
    </p>

    <h2>Snack Break</h2>
    <p>
Argle and Bargle take a break from their disagreement, enjoy some cheese and crackers over a cup of tea.

Let's say the above scenarios are not the reasons for their disagreement. Both Argle and Bargle count using the same rules - say, one finger down, one word uttered, for each marble. They use the same words for the same numbers, and perhaps even agree fully on quantities of other objects. Having been good friends for many decades, they know each other to have the same level and quality of education and have had no previous disagreements about much of anything, let alone something so contradictory as this.

"It would be fine if we were disagreeing over colour", says Argle to Bargle as they sip their tea. "If I saw this one as red, and you said it was blue, I would just think you were colourblind. Or maybe even that what you typically call red is what I call blue, and our experience is the same."
"Ah, but what if instead of using words-" Bargle said, mouth still chewing, "I looked at that marble, and when you asked me what colour it was, I pointed to that red square on your sweater?"
"I'd take that as sufficient evidence that you are consistent with your experience of colour, and it wouldn't be any trouble to teach you the words I use to reference it."
"Ah," says Bargle, having finished their chewing with a big gulp of tea. "But what if you asked me what colour that red marble was and I pointed to the blue square instead?"
"Why would you point at the blue square?" says Argle. "There's a red square right next to it."
"I know, I made it like that for you. I know how much you enjoy patchwork and references."
"And I thank you for that, it really is a lovely sweater! But again, why would you point at the wrong square? Are you being tricky again, is this some sort of silly association rule you've learned, that red marbles correspond to blue squares?"
"And I suppose you, arrogant as always, would say I need correction and another several years in kindergarten?" Bargle retorts.
"That or I'd take you to an optometrist," Argle says. "Maybe there's some trick of the light, something special about the way you look at my sweater and the marble and actually see them as the same colour."
"It would be pretty difficult if we couldn't agree on colours that way," Bargle says. "How would I then be able to ask you to pass me that red Leicester?"
    </p>

    <h2>Cylindrical Consistency</h2>
    <p>
"Have a look at this mug," says Argle, holding up the mug to Bargle by the handle. "If you look at it from this angle, the only part visible to you is this face, which looks rectangular."
"It's a cylinder," Bargle interjects.
"Yes, but play with me for a bit. From this angle it looks rectangular. And if I tilt it like this-" Argle rotates his mug to show Bargle the top of the mug "- it looks circular."
"And you've spilled some tea on me," Bargle says, "but I see what you mean. It's a cylinder, but from different angles it looks like different shapes."
"Do you think something similar is going on with the marbles?" Argle asks.
"I can't see how," Bargle frowns. "You could be certain that what you see is a rectangle, from your perspective, and I could be equally steadfast in my conviction it is a circle. But I would be happy to agree to disagree with you, because I believe with our combined wit we can reconcile that discordancy by inventing the cylinder."
"You're cocky enough to think that if you were two dimensional, you could conceive of a cylinder?" Argle quips.
"Of course!" Bargle says. "It's a worthwhile intellectual exercise if it means we can both be right. And we can argue some more, me about its circularity and you its rectangularity, and perhaps even learn from each other. We'd be consistent at least."
"Do you think something similar can be done with the marbles?" Argle asks.
"You posit the existence of some hyperdimensional - cylindrical, if you will - set of numbers?" Bargle replies. "That in some metaphysical sense, the actual number of marbles is not four or five, but cylinder-four-five - cylorive? - and I just happen to view that as five, and you as four?"
"I suppose so," Argle says. "But it's not that easy for me to imagine how. And how could I then trust you if I ask for four of something that actually exists as a set of cylorive? And you give me five things, in which case I know to treat that certain set of things with some mystical reverence outside of my comprehension of how numbers work, or you give me four, and now I don't know whether to bother with continuing to entertain the notion of cylorive?"
"Ah, we're at the point in our friendship where we are making up secret words about paranormal phenomena," Bargle says. "Next time we meet, if I asked you for cylorive crackers, you'd assume I was humouring you, or I've finally lost my grip on not just numbers but reality."
"I would give you your cylorive crackers," Argle laughs, "and I'd also give you the number to the best psychiatrist I know."
    </p>

    <h2>Wrapping up</h2>
    <p>
"I believe you when you say there are four marbles," Bargle says, "as I'm sure you believe me when I say there are five."
"And I want to resolve this disagreement," Argle says, "but frankly I don't see how wild speculation about some outside, imperceivable and fickle reality is going to help. We're going to the park next week. What if I experience a beautiful sunny day, and you're miserable because of some perceived thunderstorm?"
"You don't want to take a nice stroll through the sunderstorm?" Bargle asks.
"I'd rather we live in the same reality," Argle says. "It's more enjoyable that way."
"Agreed." Bargle stands up to clear away the empty mugs. "Would you like to play a board game? I have one I think you might enjoy."
"Sounds lovely!" Argle replies.
"What should I do with these marbles?" Bargle asks.
"Lose them."
