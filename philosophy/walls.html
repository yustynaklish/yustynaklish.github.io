    Argle: "I think houses are mostly walls."
    Bargle: "Nah surely they're like 4/6ths wall. Like a cube, you have the roof and the floor, and the other four sides are walls."
    Argle: "Surely more than 4/6ths, since houses aren't cubes - if it's rectangular then you have more wall surface area. Plus, all the internal walls."
    Bargle: "Sure, I'll concede that. Are we counting doors and windows as walls though?"
    Argle: "No, we should exclude those from the count, but I think the amount of doors or windows in a house don't drop the wall percentage down below 66%ish."
    Bargle: "Sure, I'll have to look at some sample floor plans and get some numbers to get a better heuristic."
    Peter: "My house is flooding."
